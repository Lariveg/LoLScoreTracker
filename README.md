This is the second project for the Android Beginner Scholarship with Udacity. 
The project is about creating a Score Keeper App. My LoL Score Tracker is inspired from the League of Legends game. 
In the app, you have different kind of scores you keep track of, and when the nexus button is pressed, that team wins. When one of the team wins, then the main layout disappears and a victory message appears on the screen. If you press reset, the app resets from the initial state. 
I put some screenshots with how the app looks in the screenshots directory.
